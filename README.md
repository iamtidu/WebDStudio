Welcome to WebD Studio! Our tool allows you to easily customize `div` elements into any shape using scroll bars. Instantly preview your changes and generate the corresponding HTML/CSS code to copy and paste directly into your projects. You can also preview your generated code; clicking on the code will open the code editor. 

## Key Features

- **Color Customization:** Choose colors from a variety of color palettes or create your own.
- **Real-Time Preview:** See changes as you make them.
- **In-Built Code Editor:** Preview your designs in light or dark mode.
- **Code Generation:** Generate and copy HTML/CSS code with ease.
- **Code Management:** Save or delete your generated code.

## Usage
- **Color Picker Note:** If there is a color code in the input field, the color picker will not work. Clear the input field to use the color picker.
- **Reset Properties:** Use the scroll bars to customize the div, and press [reset button] to reset the properties to their default values.
- **Checkbox Requirement:** Please check the box before using. If unchecked, it will not generate the code for that section. However, the changes will still be displayed in the `div` even if the box is unchecked, but the code will not be provided.
- **Color Palettes:** Click on any color to copy the color code to your clipboard. Note that any colors or palettes you create will not be saved after refreshing or reloading the website.
- **Code Editor:** The recent view code is saved even if you delete the generated code. However, any data typed in the code editor will not be saved. Only the most recent view of the code is preserved. Switch between light and dark modes using the "Mode" button.

## Disclaimer

Generated code is stored in local storage. If you clear the local storage, the saved data will be removed.
